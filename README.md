# Image_Encryption
Adversarial Cryptographic Model for Secure Image Transmission
Overview
This project implements an advanced cryptographic model that encrypts images being transmitted over insecure networks. The model combines neural network-based encryption with quantum-safe cryptography to ensure future-proof security. It dynamically adjusts encryption strategies based on real-time network conditions and threat levels, using blockchain for decentralized key management and storage.

Key Features
Neural Network Encryption: Differentiable encryption using custom-trained neural networks for enhanced security.
Quantum-Safe Cryptography: Utilizes quantum-resistant algorithms to safeguard against future quantum threats.
Dynamic Algorithm Selection: Automatically adapts encryption methods based on network conditions and detected threats.
Adversarial Defense: Incorporates adversarial training to protect against attacks aimed at breaking encryption.
Key-Image Encryption: Uses an image as the encryption key for added unpredictability and security.
Blockchain Key Management: Secure, decentralized management of encryption keys using blockchain technology.
