
The generator in a conditional cyclic GAN encrypts images by taking both the image and a conditional key as inputs. It processes the image through convolutional layers, using the key to guide the transformation, and outputs an encrypted version of the image. This encrypted image appears scrambled and unreadable, and the key ensures that the encryption is unique and secure. The cycle-consistency loss during training teaches the generator to also perform decryption, allowing the original image to be recovered when the same key is provided. This method enables a key-dependent, learnable encryption and decryption system for images.
