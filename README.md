# Image_Encryption using Conditional Cycle Gan using encoder-decoder structure
Adversarial Cryptographic Model for Secure Image Transmission
**Overview**
This project implements an advanced cryptographic model that encrypts images being transmitted over insecure networks. The model combines neural network-based encryption with quantum-safe cryptography to ensure future-proof security. It dynamically adjusts encryption strategies based on real-time network conditions and threat levels, using blockchain for decentralized key management and storage.

**Key Features**
Neural Network Encryption: Differentiable encryption using custom-trained neural networks for enhanced security.
Quantum-Safe Cryptography: Utilizes quantum-resistant algorithms to safeguard against future quantum threats.
Dynamic Algorithm Selection: Automatically adapts encryption methods based on network conditions and detected threats.
Adversarial Defense: Incorporates adversarial training to protect against attacks aimed at breaking encryption.
Key-Image Encryption: Uses an image as the encryption key for added unpredictability and security.

**USPs**

**Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: By integrating hash-based cryptography (like SHA-256) for key generation, your project aims to provide encryption that is resilient to quantum computing attacks, offering enhanced security.

**Robust Encryption-Decryption Cycle**: Leveraging a CycleGAN architecture, your model ensures reliable encryption and accurate decryption, making the transformation process fully reversible while maintaining the integrity of the original data.

**Key-Conditioned GAN**: The use of a conditional key input enables flexible, key-dependent encryption, where the encryption and decryption process is controlled by specific keys, adding a customizable layer of security.

**Generative Encryption Approach**: Instead of traditional encryption algorithms, your project applies generative adversarial networks (GANs) for encrypting images, presenting a novel deep learning-based approach to cryptography.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The generator model learns to transform an input image into an encrypted form based on a conditional key. This transformation is achieved through a series of convolutional layers that process the image data in a way similar to how traditional encryption algorithms operate by scrambling the data.

**Generator Structure**

Encoder: Compresses the image to a latent space, capturing important features for transformation.

Residual Blocks: Ensures that essential information about the image is not lost during the transformation.

Decoder: Expands the compressed features into the target domain while maintaining the structure of the input

**Discriminator**

â€‹**D1**:Distinguishes between real encrypted images and fake ones generated by the encryption process.

**D2**:Distinguishes between real original images and fake decrypted ones generated by the decryption process.

The discriminators help in ensuring robust encryption and accurate decryption, while guiding the generator to improve its ability to transform between encrypted and decrypted states.

***How the Discriminator Checks for Genuine Encryption***

**Feature Extraction:**

The discriminator uses convolutional layers to extract features from the input images (both real and generated). It looks for patterns and characteristics typical of encrypted images, such as noise distribution and pixel variations that differ from non-encrypted images.

**Pattern Recognition:**

Encrypted images often exhibit randomness and lack discernible features of the original image. The discriminator learns these characteristics and uses them to identify whether an image appears genuinely encrypted.
If a generated encrypted image contains too many identifiable features (i.e., it looks like the original image), the discriminator will classify it as fake.
Real vs. Fake Classification:

The output of the discriminator is a probability score indicating how likely it is that an input image is real (genuinely encrypted) or fake (generated by the GAN).
The discriminator's ability to classify accurately reflects its understanding of what constitutes valid encryption.
